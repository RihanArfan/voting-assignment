# Case Study

## Electronic Voting Systems

A number of countries currently offer some level of electronic voting system. With improvements in
technology and worries over issues such as access to polling stations, voter identification and audit
trails for voting there is a growing interest in the possibilities offered by e-voting.

In this case study, your team are bidding to SBMM, an engineering systems company, for the
contract to develop their core software for an e-voting system that could be sold around the world.
The first stage of bidding is to develop a design for your software that offers both the functionality to
support in-person and online voting using a range of voting systems, as well as providing high levels
of usability for administrators, auditors and voters.

In this first phase, you are required to demonstrate your understanding of the domain by creating a
software functional design and user interaction designs for the software.

## About the case study:

Electronic voting systems offer a number of potential benefits during elections. They can improve
the speed of vote counting, reduce the cost of running elections, improve accessibility and
potentially offer improvements in security and auditing over existing paper-based voting systems.
However, they also raise issues around voter identification, privacy and security. SBMM wish to
create an e-voting system which they can sell to countries around the world.

From research and discussions with existing providers of voting services, SBMM have determined
that they require a system that is flexible enough to support a variety of voting
mechanisms/electoral systems (such as single transferable vote, first-past-the-post, preferential
voting, etc.), as there is no international standard method for voting.

They also want the system to allow for both in-person (voting booth) and remote (online) voting, as
it is felt that this will extend the possible markets for the system.Due to worries about issues such as
privacy and security, they require a system that is robust and ideally follows existing standards
and/or meets legislation around these issues (such as GDPR). They must also be able to demonstrate
that the system is usable by a variety of users, in different countries and with different languages.

Note that this description of the desired system is not exhaustive, and part of this stage of bidding
includes researching potential requirements and features of e-voting systems to maximise the utility
of the system around the world. Your choice of features (and the justification of these choices) are
an integral part of the design process.
